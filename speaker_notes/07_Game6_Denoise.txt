## 🎤 Hook
"How does AI create art? It doesn't paint. It sculpts from chaos."

## 🧠 Concept Explanation: Diffusion
- **Forward Process**: Taking a clear image and slowly destroying it with static (Noise) until it is unrecognizable.
- **Reverse Process (Generation)**: Taking pure static and asking "What *could* this be?" and slowly cleaning it up.

## 🎢 Fun Analogy: Cloud Watching (Pareidolia)
"You look at a fluffy cloud (Random Noise).
- You think: 'That looks like a bunny!'
- Your brain fills in the details (Ears, Tail).
- Diffusion AI does exactly that. It stares at TV static and hallucinates a masterpiece."

## 🤓 Fun Fact
"Stable Diffusion was trained on 2 billion images. It has seen more art than every human who completely ever lived, combined."

## 📜 Script / Key Talking Points
- "Move the slider. See the image turn to static?"
- "Now verify the 'De-noise' button."
- "Watch it emerge from the fog. It isn't copying an image; it is *dreaming* it."
