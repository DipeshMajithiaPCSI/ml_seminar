# SPEAKER NOTES: 06_Game5_Context_Switch.txt

## 🎤 Hook
"One word can mean two completely different things based on who is saying it."

## 🧠 Concept Explanation: Context & Values (Vectors)
- **Token**: A word (e.g., "Apple").
- **Embedding**: The meaning of that word.
- **Context Switch**: Changing the meaning based on surroundings (e.g., "Apple" the fruit vs "Apple" the tech company).

## 🎢 Fun Analogy: "Bank"
"If I say 'I am going to the **bank**'... where am I going?
- If I have a fishing rod? -> River Bank.
- If I have a checkbook? -> Money Bank.
- The word is the same. The *Context* changes the destination."

## 🤓 Fun Fact
"Modern LLMs track thousands of context dimensions. They know that 'Jaguar' means a car in a sentence about speed, but a cat in a sentence about the jungle, instantly."

## 📜 Script / Key Talking Points
- "We have the word 'Play'."
- "Toggle the Context Switch involved: 'Music' vs 'Sports'."
- "Watch the values change! The AI is literally changing its mind about what the word means."
