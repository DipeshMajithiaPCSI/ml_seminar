## 🎤 Hook
"You don't read every word in a book. You skim. AI used to be bad at skimming."

## 🧠 Concept Explanation: Attention Mechanism
- **Old Way (RNNs)**: Reading word by word by word. Forgetting the beginning by the time you reach the end.
- **New Way (Transformers)**: Looking at the *whole page* at once and shining a spotlight on what matters.

## 🎢 Fun Analogy: The Cocktail Party Effect
"Imagine you are at a noisy party. 100 people are talking.
- You don't listen to everyone.
- You filter out the noise and 'attend' only to the person saying your name or sharing gossip.
- That filter is the **Attention Mechanism**."

## 🤓 Fun Fact
"The paper that invented this changed the world overnight. It was titled simply: 'Attention Is All You Need'. It is the reason ChatGPT exists today."

## 📜 Script / Key Talking Points
- "Look at the blurred text."
- "Hover your mouse. See how it clears up?"
- "See how keywords light up? That is the AI deciding 'This word is important'."
- "Without attention, AI is like a student who memorizes the textbook but understands nothing."
