## 🎤 Hook
"Okay, the AI is broken. It thinks a Pizza costs $500. Let's fix it."

## 🧠 Concept Explanation: Gradient Descent & Loss
Here we introduce **Training**.
- **Error (Loss)**: Distinct between the prediction (Red Point) and reality (Green Point).
- **Sliders (Weights/Bias)**: The knobs we turn to reduce the error.
- **The Goal**: Minimize the distance.

## 🎢 Fun Analogy: The Lost Hiker (Gradient Descent)
"Imagine you are lost on a mountain at night (High Error). You want to get to the village in the valley (Low Error).
- You can't see the whole map.
- You can only feel the slope under your feet.
- If it goes down, you take a step.
- That's **Gradient Descent**. Taking small steps downhill until you reach the bottom (Zero Error)."

## 🤓 Fun Fact
"In massive models like GPT-4, they aren't tuning 2 sliders. They are tuning **1.7 Trillion** sliders simultaneously. And they are doing it blindly, just feeling the slope!"

## 📜 Script / Key Talking Points
- "Look at the red line. It's terrible. The error is huge."
- "Move the 'Weight' slider. See the line rotate? That's the slope."
- "Move the 'Bias' slider. See the line move up/down? That's the intercept."
- "Your job is to make the Error go to zero. Go!"
- "When you succeed, realize this: You just performed 'Backpropagation' manually."
