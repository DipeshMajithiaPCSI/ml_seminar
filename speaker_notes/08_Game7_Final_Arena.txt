## 🎤 Hook
"You are now the Architect. It's time to build your own AI from scratch."

## 🧠 Concept Explanation: The Final Integration
This game combines everything.
1.  **Linear Regression**: The Foundation.
2.  **Multiple Regression**: Handling Complexity.
3.  **Self-Attention**: Understanding Relationships.
4.  **Attention Mechanism**: Focusing Focus.
5.  **Diffusion**: Creativity.

## 🎢 Visual Feedback Guide (What to look for!)
Since we "Show, Don't Tell", guide the audience to these cues:

### Stage 1: Linear Regression (Ice Cream vs Temp)
-   **Wrong Answer**: "Look at that RED line! It connects every dot like a crazy zig-zag. That is **Overfitting**. It memorized the noise."
-   **Correct Answer**: "See the BLUE line? It cuts through the middle. It ignores the outliers. That is **Generalization**."

### Stage 2: Multiple Regression (Sales Prediction)
-   **Wrong Answer**: "You only connected 'Temperature'. You ignored 'Price'. The model failed."
-   **Correct Answer**: "All 3 inputs connected! The network is fully dense."

### Stage 3: Self-Attention (The Robot)
-   **Wrong Answer**: "The model thinks 'IT' refers to 'Apple'. Apples don't get hungry! Context failure."
-   **Correct Answer**: "IT -> Robot. Perfect. It understands the sentence logic."

### Stage 4: Attention Mechanism (The Spotlight)
-   **Wrong Answer**: "Whoa, **Floodlight**! It's highlighting everything. That's inefficient."
-   **Correct Answer**: "**Spotlight** on! Only the key terms lit up."

### Stage 5: Diffusion (The Art)
-   **Wrong Answer**: "Glitch city. Just random pixels rearrangements."
-   **Correct Answer**: "From noise... to Art. That is the power of Generative AI."

## 📜 Script / Key Talking Points
- "This is the final exam. But it's visual."
- "If you get it wrong, don't worry—look at the visual. It will show you WHY it failed."
- "When you finish this, you are officially a Gradient Descent Graduate."
